# Capstone_YOLO_training_datasource
## Introduction
This is the self-labeled data for Aeolus Computer vision backend.
There are three parts:
* images: containing all the images from three data sources
* labels: self-labelling of the cracks on these images
* test.txt: for training of model
* train.txt: for training of model
* yolov3-obj_3100.weights: weight of crack detection after training 3100 epoches
* yolov3-obj_1300.weights: weight of crack detection after training 1300 epoches


## How to use it:
### If you just want to use it for detection:
Get capstone server code from https://github.com/Gilliamwu/Capstone_DB_code

Put the  yolov3-obj_3100.weights under backup folder. If backup folder doesn't exist, create one.

Remember to edit settings.py and update the weight name

### If you have new images, and further train the model
The training of the whole model is based on this post: https://timebutt.github.io/static/how-to-train-yolov2-to-detect-custom-objects/

Get the modified darknet version from https://github.com/Gilliamwu/darknet

Put the weight file you want to start under backup folder.

copy images and labesl under data/obj

copy train.txt and test.txt

Follow instructionss of darknet, run following commands (assume we start from weight 3100)


## How to add your own data
### launch BBox training tool to do the labelling
Find the labelling tool from here: https://github.com/puzzledqs/BBox-Label-Tool

Remember to translate all images to JPEG. Put them under Images folder with number, and in the main window, key in the number and label

### translate BBox label to YOLO label
Use labelling_tool/convert.py, to convert the crack data to YOLO data

### generate train.txt and test.txt
Use labelling_tool/generate_train_test_list.py to generate two files, separating data to train and test.
